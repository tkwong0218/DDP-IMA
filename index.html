	      <h1>What is Corgi?</h1>
	      <p>The Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name "Corgi" is derived from the Welsh words "Cor" and "Gi", meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.<br><br>

          There are two breeds of Corgi: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical differences between the two different breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking had previously been performed.</p><br><br>

    <!-- Facts -->
         <h1>Breeds of Corgi</h1>
         <h3>Cardigan Welsh Corgis</h3>
         <p>Cardigan Welsh Corgis were first bred in Cardiganshire Wales over 3,000 years ago, making them the eldest of the two breeds of Welsh Corgis. They were originally bred to herd cattle as their short stature gave them the ability to nip at the heels of the herd without being kicked or injured.<br><br>

          Cardigan Welsh Corgis were brought then brought to Great Britain in the 1800s where they were worked on tenant farms. They soon became adored by both farmers and British royalty alike. Many royal families have adopted and bred Corgis.</p>

         <h3>Pembroke Welsh Corgis</h3>
         <p>Like Cardigan Welsh Corgis, Pembroke Corgis were best bred in Wales, although they were native to Pembrokeshire Wales. They are also used to herd farm animals, mainly horses. As well, they were known for being hunting dogs and similar to Cardigan Corgis, they were well-loved by royalty.<br><br>

         Until the 1800s, Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis were interbred. It wasn’t until the 1920s that they were officially recognized as two separate breeds by the UK Kennel Club and 1935 by the American Kennel Club. To this day, they are among the top 50 most popular dog breeds.</p>
