	      <h1>What is Corgi?</h1>
	      <p>The Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name "corgi" is derived from the Welsh words "cor" and "ci" (which is mutated to ‘gi’), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.<br><br>

          Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical differences between the two different breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking had previously been performed.</p>
